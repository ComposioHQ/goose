  </TabItem>

## Authentication

Rube uses OAuth browser authentication, which means:
- No manual API keys to manage
- Secure authentication handled automatically
- When you first use a Rube tool, your browser will open to authenticate with the relevant service
- Authentication tokens are securely stored and managed by Rube

## Benefits of Using Rube

1. **Unified Interface**: One extension to access 500+ apps instead of managing multiple MCP servers
2. **Simplified Authentication**: OAuth flows handled automatically - no manual API key management
3. **Cross-App Workflows**: Easily chain actions across different services
4. **Always Up-to-Date**: New app integrations and API updates handled by the Rube team
5. **Secure**: Enterprise-grade security with OAuth 2.0 and secure token management

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not connecting**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and that `https://rube.app` is accessible from your network.

**Authentication issues**: If OAuth flows aren't working, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.

**Tool timeouts**: Some operations with large datasets may take longer. You can increase the timeout value in the extension settings if needed.

**Rate limits**: Rube respects the rate limits of individual services. If you hit limits, wait a few minutes before retrying.
