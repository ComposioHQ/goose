Rube will handle the authentication flow for each service as needed and execute the requested actions across multiple platforms seamlessly. The exact output will depend on your connected applications and their current state.

## Authentication

When you first use Rube with a specific application:

1. Rube will prompt you to authenticate with the target service
2. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser
3. Future interactions with that service will use the stored credentials
4. You can manage connected applications through Rube's interface

## Benefits

- **Seamless Authentication**: OAuth flows handled automatically
- **Cross-Platform Actions**: Execute workflows spanning multiple applications
- **Natural Language Interface**: Describe what you want to accomplish in plain English
- **Always Up-to-Date**: New integrations added regularly without needing to update Goose

## Getting Started

1. Add the Rube extension using the configuration steps above
2. Start a conversation with Goose
3. Try commands like "Send an email via Gmail" or "Create a task in Notion"
4. Rube will guide you through any required authentication steps
5. Begin automating workflows across your connected applications
